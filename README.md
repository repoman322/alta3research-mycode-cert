Python API cert work

Start with the Requests script to download from the web some Game Of Thrones Characters (random). The pull will be saved as a JSON file named test.json.

Next run the Flask script to import the json data and import into a SQLite3 database.

The Home HTML page will have option to list current database info, along with other buttons to explore.

Import the json file from the Import database entries from file button.  This will automatically load the test.json file content into the database.

View the content, etc

Enjoy!
